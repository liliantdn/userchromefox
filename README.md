# userchromefox
A work-in-progress userchrome.css theme for firefox that attempts to strike a comfortable balance between google chrome and firefox's base theme.

1. Go to about:config, set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true` (if it is unset, click the `+` button).
-  Go to `about:support`.
- Find *Profile Folder* and click the `Open Folder` button.
- Put the `chrome` folder into your Firefox profile directory.
- Restart Firefox to apply changes.

## Known issues:
